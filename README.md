# Unity-Ludo-Framework

A framework that allows you to easily create a ludo-style game.

This is a Unity project for creating any type of Ludo game. The basic scenes are setup for a mobile-based 2D Ludo game with working AI. This can be easily extended to a 3D game or a completely different Ludo game if needed.

## Menu Interface

It also features my own menu system which you can use for any game project.

I needed a menu that is minimal, easy to navigate, has subtle animations and looks slick.

## Options

> Every provided asset is a placeholder - you should use your own images, sounds, etc.

... with that out of the way, the project currently features basic options you can customize from the inspector, and everything else you can customize through the scripts provided.

The basic gameplay and AI options accessible through the inspector:
